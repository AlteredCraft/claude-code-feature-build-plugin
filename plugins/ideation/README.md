# Ideation

A structured product consultation workflow for Claude Code that helps refine project ideas into fully-formed design specifications.

## What It Does

This plugin adds a `/ac-ideation:dev-product-brainstorm` command that guides you through a three-phase consultation process:

1. **Idea Refinement** — Strategic questioning to understand purpose, scope, requirements, constraints, and success criteria
2. **Design Presentation** — Section-by-section design specification with iterative feedback
3. **Final Specification** — Comprehensive design document with justifications and research links

## Why Use It

Ideas are messy. Jumping straight to implementation often means building the wrong thing. This workflow forces structured thinking before coding begins:

- Surfaces hidden assumptions through focused questions
- Builds shared understanding incrementally
- Captures design rationale alongside decisions
- Produces a reference spec you can return to

## Installation

### From GitHub

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add AlteredCraft/claude-code-plugins

# Install the plugin
/plugin install ac-ideation@alteredcraft-plugins
```

### Manual Installation

Clone this repository and add it as a local marketplace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlteredCraft/claude-code-plugins.git
cd claude-code-plugins

# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add ./
/plugin install ac-ideation@alteredcraft-plugins
```

## Usage

### Start a consultation

```bash
/ac-ideation:dev-product-brainstorm
```

Or with an initial idea:

```bash
/ac-ideation:dev-product-brainstorm Build a CLI tool for managing dotfiles across machines
```

### The process

1. Claude asks focused questions one at a time, offering suggestions
2. Once requirements are clear, Claude presents the design in sections
3. You approve or refine each section before moving on
4. Final output is a comprehensive design specification

## Sample interaction

```
  > /project-brainstorm I would like to create a todo app to track my personal tasks


  <thinking ...>


  This is more valuable than jumping to platform or features because the answer will inform all subsequent questions.

  Given that you already use Todoist (as noted in your PKM setup), I'm curious about the motivation behind building a custom solution.
  This will significantly shape the entire design direction.

  Question: What's driving you to build your own todo app rather than continuing with Todoist or another existing solution?

  A) Specific pain points - Todoist doesn't do something you need (e.g., specific integrations, workflow, data ownership)
  B) Learning project - You want to build something practical to learn new technologies or patterns
  C) Simplicity - You want something lighter/simpler than full-featured tools
  D) Customization - You want complete control to tailor it exactly to your workflow
  E) Something else - Please describe

  My suggestion: Given your background in Clean Architecture, I suspect this might be a combination of B and D
  , a practical learning project where you can apply architectural principles while building something tailored
  to your specific workflow. But I'd like to confirm what's most important to you.
